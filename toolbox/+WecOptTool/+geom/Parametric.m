classdef Parametric < WecOptTool.geom.AbsGeom
    % Vary device geometry parametrically.
    %
    % For the RM3 study the design variables are
    %
    %     * ``r1``: the radius of the surface float
    %     * ``r2``: the radius of the heave plate
    %     * ``d1``: the draft of the surface float
    %     * ``d2``: the depth of the heave plate,
    %
    % The resulting design array is given as ``x = [r1, r2, d1, d2]``.
    %
    % Args:
    %     x0 (double[4]): optimisation initial guess
    %     upperBound (double[4]): optimisation upper bound
    %     lowerBound (double[4]): optimisation lower bound
    %     varargin: optional name-value pair arguments (see below)
    %
    % The following options are supported:
    %
    %   freqStep (float):
    %     Angular frequency discretisation step used in NEMOH calculations. 
    %     Defaults to 0.2 (rad/s).
