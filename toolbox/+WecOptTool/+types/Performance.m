classdef Performance < WecOptTool.base.Data
    % Data type for storage of the controlled WEC performance.
    %
    % This data type defines a set of parameters that are common to 
    % analysis of controlled WEC performance.
    %
    % The following parameters must be provided within the input struct 
    % (any additional parameters given will also be stored within the 
    % created object:
    %
    %     * powPerFreq
    %
    % The following additional parameters are available following 
    % instantiation of the object:
    %
    %     * pow
    %
    % Once created, the parameters in the object are read only, but the
    % object can be converted to a struct, and then modified.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %    input (struct):
    %        A struct (not array) whose fields represent the parameters
    %        to be stored.
    %
    % Attributes:
    %     powPerFreq (array of float):
    %         The exported power of the WEC per wave frequency
    %     pow (float):
    %         The total exported power of the WEC.
    %
    % Methods:
    %    struct(): convert to struct
    %
    % Note:
    %    To create an array of Performance objects see the
    %    :mat:func:`+WecOptTool.types` function.
