function mesh = mesh(meshName, folder, varargin)
    % Make a mesh using shortcuts to the ``makeMesh`` method of the 
    % defined Mesher concrete classes in the :mat:mod:`+WecOptTool.+mesh` 
    % package.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %     meshName (string):
    %         Meshing routine to use. Current options are:
    %              
    %              * AxiMesh (:mat:class:`+WecOptTool.+mesh.AxiMesh`)
    %
    %     folder (string):
    %         Path to the folder to store output files
    %     varargin:
    %         Arguments to pass to the meshing routine. See the
    %         ``makeMesh`` method of the chosen mesher class for details.
    %
    % Returns:
    %    struct:
    %        A mesh description with fields as described below
    %
    % ============  ================  ======================================
    % **Variable**  **Format**        **Description**
    % bodyNum       int32             body number
    % name          char array        name of the mesh
    % nodes         Nx4 table         table of N node positions with columns ID, x, y, z
    % panels        Mx4 int32 array   array of M panels where each row contains the 4 connected node IDs
    % xzSymmetric   logical           body is symmetric in xz plane (half mesh)
    % zG            double            z-coordinate of the bodies centre of gravity
