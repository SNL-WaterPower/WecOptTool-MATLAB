function result = isClose(a, b, varargin)
    % Determine if two values are numerically close (but perhaps not
    % exactly equal).
    %
    % Args:
    %   a (float): first value to compare
    %   b (float): second value to compare
    %   rtol (float, optional): relative tolerence, default = 1e-05
    %   atol (float, optional): absolute tolerance, default = 1e-08
    %
    % Returns:
    %   bool: true if a is within given tolerances of b
