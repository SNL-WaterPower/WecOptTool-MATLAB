WecOptTool
##########

The WEC Design Optimization MATLAB Toolbox (WecOptTool) allows users to perform 
wave  energy converter (WEC) device design optimization studies while including
different control strategies. In particular, this tool's key feature is the 
usage of a pseudo spectral solution method capable of dealing with both 
constraints and nonlinear dynamics. This allows for the optimzation study to 
find the best possible power capture performance within the system constraints 
(e.g., maximum power take-off force).

The initial release of WecOptTool allows the user to perform design optimization
studies on the `RM3 point absorber`_ (see the :ref:`optimization` section for 
further details). Subsequent releases will provide a generalized framework 
allowing users to consider arbitrary devices of their choosing.

WecOptTool is developed by `Sandia National Laboratories`_, with support from 
`Data Only Greater`_. The developers would also like to acknowledge benefit from
past collaborations with the `Oregon State University Design Engineering Lab`_.
