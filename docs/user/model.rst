Creating a New WEC Model
************************

This section explains how to create a WecOptTool model for a new WEC and will
be completed shortly.

The WecOptTool framework encapsulates the WEC design and control 
co-optimization process using two key classes. The 
:mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` class is used to describe the potential 
forms (e.g. shape, control type, etc.) that a WEC device might take. The user 
of WecOptTool must create a `concrete subclass 
<https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/abstract-classes-and-interface 
s.html>`_ of the :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` class that describes the 
potential geometry, motion and control options for their chosen WEC design. For 
this example, the subclass is already prepared in the |RM3.m|_ file.

The :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` class represents a device with a chosen 
set of design parameters, created from a Blueprint subclass. Once the user has 
created a Blueprint subclass, Device objects are created using the Blueprint, 
for a specified design and control system. For more information on how 
Blueprint and Device classes are used see the :ref:`optimization` and 
:ref:`api` sections.
