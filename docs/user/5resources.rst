Additional Reading
==================

The following references specifically focusing on WecOptTool are available:

	* **Optimal control of wave energy converters** :cite:`Bacelli2014` - While written years before the development of WecOptTool, Giorgio Bacelli's doctoral thesis provides much of the framework upon which WecOptTool is based.
	* **Initial conceptual demonstration of control co-design for WEC optimization** :cite:`Coe2020initial` - This paper presents the basic framework of WecOptTool along with a series of examples using the Sandia WaveBot.
