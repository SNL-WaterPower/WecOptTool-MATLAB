Overview
========

This section explains and expands upon the |optimization.m|_ example file provided in the ``examples/RM3`` directory of the WecOptTool source code.
This example considers the DOE Reference Model 3 (RM3_) device.

The general concept of WecOptTool is illustrated in the diagram below organized into three columns. 

    * **User Inputs** (Green) - aspects of the tool that the user can interact with
    * **Data Classes** (Blue) - objects used to store and transfer information within a study
    * **Solvers** (Yellow) - physics models and optimization algorithms that process data

To run WecOptTool the user will need to define each of the six input blocks in the User Inputs column.
For the RM3, the Geometry will be defined by a mesh and design variables (:math:`r_1, r_2, d_1, d_2`), which refer to the spar/float radius and distance between the surface water level and the distance between the two boides.
In the Power Take Off (PTO) input, the user will define constraints on the PTO such as max force, :math:`F_{max}`, and max stroke :math:`\Delta 
x_{max}` and an operational constraint, :math:`H_{s,max}`.).
Lastly, the kinematics will define how the two bodies of the RM3 move relative to the resource and relative degrees of freedom. 

Next, the user will choose one of three controllers to compute the resulting dynamics(``ProportionalDamping``, ``ComplexConjugate``, ``PseudoSpectral``).
The Sea States input block for the RM3 may made up of a single spctrum or multiple spectra.
Finally, the user will need to determine some objective function of interest for the device being studied.

WecOptTool will use the User inputs to build a set of Data Classes and pass the information to the Solvers.
The Hydrodynamics Solver currently uses Nemoh_ to compute the linear wave-body interaction properties using the boundary element method (BEM).
The Optimal Control Solver will take the Data Classes to return device results for the given controller and sea state.
This output, paired with some cost proxy from the device, can be used to evaluate the objective function inside the Optimization Routine.

In WecOptTool, this process is executed by applying the following steps:

#. Select a WEC Blueprint (RM3, in this case)
#. Create one or many Devices using the Blueprint
#. Examine the performance each Device object for a given seastate

The remainder of this page will illustrate (using the |optimization.m|_ example) how this process is applied to a co-optimisation problem.
For more information about the :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` and :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` classes see the :ref:`model` and :ref:`api` 
sections. 

Create an RM3 object
====================

Once defined, :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` subclasses are easy to
initialize:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 5-6
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 5

Define a seastate
=================

WecOptTool can simulate single or multiple spectra sea states, where weightings can be provided to indicate the relative likelihood of each spectra.
The following lines from |optimization.m|_ provide means of using the WAFO_ MATLAB toolbox or preset spectra from WecOptTool.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 8-17
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 8

Spectra are formatted following the convention of the WAFO_ MATLAB toolbox, but can be generated in via any means (e.g., from buoy measurements) as long as the 
structure includes the ``S.S``, ``S.w``, and ``S.phi`` fields.

.. code:: matlab

    S = 

      struct with fields:

           S: [257×1 double]
           w: [257×1 double]
          tr: []
           h: Inf
        type: 'freq'
         phi: 0
        norm: 0
        note: 'Bretschneider, Hm0 = 4, Tp = 5'
        date: '25-Mar-2020 13:08:28'

In the active code above from |optimization.m|_, there are eight spectra loaded into a |struct array|_.
These can be plotted using standard MATLAB commands.

.. code:: matlab

    figure
    hold on
    grid on
    arrayfun(@(x) plot(x.w,x.S,'DisplayName',x.note), S)
    legend()
    xlim([0,3])
    xlabel('Freq. [rad/s]')
    ylabel('Spect. density [m^2 rad/s]')

.. image:: /_static/example_spectra.svg
   :alt: Eight spectra consider in example.m

The desired spectrum or spectra must now be converted into a 
:mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` data type object.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 19-21
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 19

The :mat:func:`+WecOptTool.types` function is the preferred method for creating data type object arrays.
The :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` class allows the user to manipulate the given spectra to the requirements of the experiment. Automatically, the weighting parameter ``mu`` will be set to unity when multiple sea-states are given with ``mu`` undefined.
In this example, frequencies that have less than 1% of the maximum spectral density are also removed, (using the ``"trimFrequencies"`` option) to increase the speed of computation with minimal loss of accuracy.
See the :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` documentation for all available options.

Create an objective function
============================

Next, we create the objective function we wish to minimise.
Note, this function must be defined at the bottom of the script, although we will use
it above.
The full function is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 67-84
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 67

The following subsections will describe each stage of setting up the objective
function.

Define the inputs
-----------------

The input definition of an objective function used in WecOptTool is typically
going to take the form::

    function result = myObjFun(x, blueprint, seastate)

where ``x`` is the solution to be tested, ``blueprint`` is a Blueprint subclass object and ``seastate`` is a SeaState data type object.
Although in most cases only ``x`` will vary, the other inputs will be required within the optimization
function and can't be accessed through the global workspace.

Define design variables
-----------------------

As shown in the diagram below, for RM3 study considered in |optimization.m|_ the design variables are the radius of the surface float, ``r1``, the radius of 
the heave plate, ``r2``, the draft of the surface float, ``d1``, and the depth of the heave plate, ``d2``, such that ``x = [r1, r2, d1, d2]``.
The optimization algorithm will attempt to find the values of ``x`` that minimize the objective function. 

.. image:: /_static/example_rm3Parametric.svg
   :width: 400pt
   :alt: RM3 device parametric dimensions

In WecOptTool, design options for geometry and controllers are supplied in `struct arrays <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-a-structure-array.html>`_ using the field ``type`` to define which option is desired and ``params`` to supply the chosen option with it's required parameters, in a cell array.
The ``'parametric'`` option is defined as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 73
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 73

The parametric option requires 5 arguments, the geometry design variables, ``r1, r2, d1, d2``, and a representative set of angular frequencies to be calculated by NEMOH.
The design variables will be passed by the optimisation routine, while the frequencies can be extracted from the given :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` object using its :mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState.getRegularFrequencies` method, which provides regularly spaced frequencies covering all spectra in the object array. 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 74-75
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 74

Add a controller
----------------

In the RM3 example, three types of controllers are defined:

 - **Proportional Damping** (``'P'``): Resistive damping (i.e., a proportional feedback on velocity) (see, e.g., [Falnes]_). Here, the power take-off (PTO) force is set as

   .. math::
     F_u(\omega) = -B_{PTO}(\omega)u(\omega)

   where :math:`B_{PTO}` is a constant chosen to maximize absorbed power and :math:`u(\omega)` is the velocity. |br| |br|
   
 - **Complex Conjugate** (``'CC'``): Optimal power absorption through impedance matching (see, e.g., [Falnes]_). The intrinsic impedance is given by 

   .. math::
    Z_i(\omega) = B(\omega) + i \left( \omega{}(m + A(\omega)) - \frac{K_{HS}}{\omega}\right) ,

   where :math:`\omega` is the radial frequency, :math:`B(\omega)` is the 
   radiation damping, :math:`m` is the rigid body mass, :math:`A(\omega)` is the
   added mass, and :math:`K_{HS}` is the hydrostatic stiffness. Optimal power 
   transfer occurs when the PTO force, :math:`F_u` is set such
   that

   .. math::
    F_u(\omega) = -Z_i^*(\omega)u(\omega) ,

   where :math:`u(\omega)` is the velocity. |br| |br|

 - **Pseudo Spectral** (``'PS'``): Constrained optimal power absorption 
   [Bacelli]_. This is a numerical optimal control algorithm capable of dealing 
   with both constraints and nonlinear dynamics. This approach is based on 
   |pseudo spectral method|_.

For the |optimization.m|_ example we choose the Complex Conjugate option, which 
requires no additional arguments:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 76
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 76

Create and evaluate the device
------------------------------

Now that the design options are set, the devices can be created and their
performance evaluated for a given seastate. To create the device, the 
:mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint.makeDevices` method of the ``RM3`` object 
is used with the defined geometry and controller options:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 78
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 78

To evaluate the device's performance, the 
:mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Device.simulate` method is called on the created
device with the given :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` object.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 79
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 79

Define the objective function value
-----------------------------------

The final step is to use data stored in the device to define the objective function value.
The :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` definition gives a full list of the data available in the device, but for this case 'aggregated results' found in the :mat:attr:`~+WecOptTool.Device.aggregation` property (which is populated by a user defined callback) are used.
In |RM3.m|_ the maximum absorbed power across all spectra in the given seastate is calculated and added as ``pow``.
To make a minimisation problem, the negation of this value is taken: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 80
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 80

.. note::
    **Objective function:** The chosen objective function in |optimization.m|_ 
    can be altered to better approximate a more meaningful objective (e.g., 
    levelized cost of energy).

Set optimization solver
=======================

MATLAB's `fmincon <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html>`_ optimization solver is used in |optimization.m|_.

The initial values, ``x0``, lower bounds, ``lb``, and upper bounds, ``ub`` of the design variables can be set as follows.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 25-28
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 25

Options can also be supplied for fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 30-38
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 30

.. note::
    The ``MaxFunctionEvaluations`` is set to 5 in |optimization.m|_ to permit relatively quick runs, but can be increased to allow for a potentially better solution (with the other options left as-is, this should require 150 function evaluations).

.. image:: /_static/example_optimplotfval.svg
   :alt: Progression of objective function value for RM3 example

In order to pass the above options, some dummy values must also be supplied for other arguments required by fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 40-45
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 40

Run study and view results
==========================

Before using the objective function, the inputs must be simplified to allow fmincon to just pass the design variables.
To do this an `anonymous function <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html>`_ is defined, which requires the design variables as input and fixes the value of the Blueprint and SeaState object inputs: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 49-50
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 49

The study can be executed by calling fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 52-53
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 52

Once the calculation is complete, the ``x`` and ``fval`` variables show that the study has produced the following design: 

* :math:`r_1`: 5 [m]
* :math:`r_2`: 7.5 [m]
* :math:`d_1`: 1.125 [m]
* :math:`d_2`: 42 [m]
* Maximum absorbed power: 2357934.25081 [W]

Examine optimum device
======================

When MATLAB is executed in parallel, objects are copied to the parallel workers, executed and then destroyed.
Therefore only the function value of each iteration remains in the MATLAB workspace.
To allow the created devices to be recovered, WecOptTool stores their data in files, so that it can be retrieved later if desired.
To recover the devices, the :mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint.recoverDevices` method of the Blueprint subclass is called, which returns an array of :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` objects: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 55-56
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 55

.. warning::
    Once recovered, ownership of the files containing the stored data for
    the devices is transferred from the Blueprint to the Device objects. 
    Therefore, when the Device objects are deleted, so are the associated 
    files.

Next, the device that matches the best solution returned by fmincon must be found.
To do this, compare the :mat:attr:`~+WecOptTool.Device.geomParams` parameter of the devices, until a match is found, as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 58-63
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 58

Finally, by using the :mat:func:`+WecOptTool.+plot.powerPerFreq` function, the spectral distribution of energy absorbed by the resulting design for each of the eight sea states can be shown. 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 65
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 65
