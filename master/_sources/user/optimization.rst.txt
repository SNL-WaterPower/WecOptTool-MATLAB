This section explains and expands upon the |optimization.m|_ example file 
provided in the ``examples/RM3`` directory of the WecOptTool source code. This 
example considers the DOE Reference Model 3 (RM3_) device.

The general concept of WecOptTool is illustrated in the diagram below. In the 
upper left-hand corner, an optimization algorithm controls the selection of a 
set of design variables. In this diagram, some geometric design variables, 
:math:`r_1, r_2, d_1, d_2`, are considered along with constraints on the power 
take-off (PTO) max force, :math:`F_{max}`, and max stroke :math:`\Delta 
x_{max}` and an operational constraint, :math:`H_{s,max}`. The device defined 
by these design variables is passed to the grey *evaluation* block. Here, 
Nemoh_ is used to compute the linear wave-body interaction properties using the 
boundary element method (BEM). Next, using these properties and some set of sea 
states, one of three controllers (``ProportionalDamping``, 
``ComplexConjugate``, ``PseudoSpectral``) are used to compute the resulting 
dynamics. These dynamics and some model for cost (e.g., based on the size 
dimensions and the capabilities of the PTO) can be combined to produce an 
objective function, which is returned to the optimization solver.

In WecOptTool, this process is executed by applying the following steps:

#. Select a WEC Blueprint (RM3, in this case)
#. Create one or many Devices using the Blueprint
#. Examine the performance each Device object for a given seastate

The remainder of this page will illustrate (using the |optimization.m|_ 
example) how this process is applied to a co-optimisation problem. For more 
information about the :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` and 
:mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` classes see the :ref:`model` and :ref:`api` 
sections. 

Create an RM3 object
====================

Once defined, :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint` subclasses are easy to
initialize:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 5-6
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 5

Define a seastate
=================

WecOptTool can simulate single or multiple spectra sea states, where weightings
can be provided to indicate the relative likelihood of each spectra. The 
following lines from |optimization.m|_ provide means of using the WAFO_ MATLAB 
toolbox or preset spectra from WecOptTool.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 8-17
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 8

Spectra are formatted following the convention of the WAFO_ MATLAB toolbox, but 
can be generated in via any means (e.g., from buoy measurements) as long as the 
structure includes the ``S.S``, ``S.w``, and ``S.phi`` fields.

.. code:: matlab

    S = 

      struct with fields:

           S: [257×1 double]
           w: [257×1 double]
          tr: []
           h: Inf
        type: 'freq'
         phi: 0
        norm: 0
        note: 'Bretschneider, Hm0 = 4, Tp = 5'
        date: '25-Mar-2020 13:08:28'

In the active code above from |optimization.m|_, there are eight spectra loaded into 
a |struct array|_. These can be plotted using standard MATLAB commands.

.. code:: matlab

    figure
    hold on
    grid on
    arrayfun(@(x) plot(x.w,x.S,'DisplayName',x.note), S)
    legend()
    xlim([0,3])
    xlabel('Freq. [rad/s]')
    ylabel('Spect. density [m^2 rad/s]')

.. image:: /_static/example_spectra.svg
   :alt: Eight spectra consider in example.m

The desired spectrum or spectra must now be converted into a 
:mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` data type object.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 19-20
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 19

The purpose of data type classes is to validate that the required parameters 
for the different stages of the design process have been provided, to give the 
user a clear method to understand and access the data used in WecOptTool and, 
in some circumstances, to add additional data that is automatically generated 
from the given variables. For instances, for the 
:mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` class, the weighting parameter ``mu`` 
will be set to unity when multiple seastates are given with ``mu`` left
undefined. The :mat:func:`+WecOptTool.types` function is the preferred method 
for creating data type object arrays. 

Create an objective function
============================

Next, we create the objective function we wish to minimise. Note, this
function must be defined at the bottom of the script, although we will use
it above. The full function is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 65-80
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 65

The following subsections will describe each stage of setting up the objective
function.

Define the inputs
-----------------

The input definition of an objective function used in WecOptTool is typically
going to take the form::

    function result = myObjFun(x, blueprint, seastate)

where ``x`` is the solution to be tested, ``blueprint`` is a Blueprint subclass
object and ``seastate`` is a SeaState data type object. Although in most cases
only ``x`` will vary, the other inputs will be required within the optimization
function and can't be accessed through the global workspace.

Define design variables
-----------------------

As shown in the diagram below, for RM3 study considered in |optimization.m|_ 
the design variables are the radius of the surface float, ``r1``, the radius of 
the heave plate, ``r2``, the draft of the surface float, ``d1``, and the depth 
of the heave plate, ``d2``, such that ``x = [r1, r2, d1, d2]``. The 
optimization algorithm will attempt to find the values of ``x`` that minimize 
the objective function. 

.. image:: /_static/example_rm3Parametric.svg
   :width: 400pt
   :alt: RM3 device parametric dimensions

In WecOptTool, design options for geometry and controllers are supplied in 
`struct arrays <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-a-structure-array.html>`_ 
using the field ``type`` to define which option is desired and ``params`` to 
supply the chosen option with it's required parameters, in a cell array. For 
the ``'parametric'`` option, 6 arguments must be supplied, the geometry design 
variables, ``r1, r2, d1, d2``, a representative seastate and the frequency step 
to be used for the NEMOH calculations. The design variables will be passed by 
the optimisation routine, so we add the seastate and the frequency step as 
follows: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 72-73
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 72

Add a controller
----------------

In the RM3 example, three types of controllers are defined:

 - **Proportional Damping** (``'P'``): Resistive damping (i.e., a proportional 
   feedback on velocity) (see, e.g., [Falnes]_). Here, the power take-off (PTO) 
   force is set as

   .. math::
     F_u(\omega) = -B_{PTO}(\omega)u(\omega)

   where :math:`B_{PTO}` is a constant chosen to maximize absorbed power and 
   :math:`u(\omega)` is the velocity. |br| |br|
   
 - **Complex Conjugate** (``'CC'``): Optimal power absorption through impedance 
   matching (see, e.g., [Falnes]_). The intrinsic impedance is given by 

   .. math::
    Z_i(\omega) = B(\omega) + i \left( \omega{}(m + A(\omega)) - \frac{K_{HS}}{\omega}\right) ,

   where :math:`\omega` is the radial frequency, :math:`B(\omega)` is the 
   radiation damping, :math:`m` is the rigid body mass, :math:`A(\omega)` is the
   added mass, and :math:`K_{HS}` is the hydrostatic stiffness. Optimal power 
   transfer occurs when the PTO force, :math:`F_u` is set such
   that

   .. math::
    F_u(\omega) = -Z_i^*(\omega)u(\omega) ,

   where :math:`u(\omega)` is the velocity. |br| |br|

 - **Pseudo Spectral** (``'PS'``): Constrained optimal power absorption 
   [Bacelli]_. This is a numerical optimal control algorithm capable of dealing 
   with both constraints and nonlinear dynamics. This approach is based on 
   |pseudo spectral method|_.

For the |optimization.m|_ example we choose the Complex Conjugate option, which 
requires no additional arguments:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 74
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 74

Create and evaluate the device
------------------------------

Now that the design options are set, the devices can be created and their
performance evaluated for a given seastate. To create the device, the 
:mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint.makeDevices` method of the ``RM3`` object 
is used with the defined geometry and controller options:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 76
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 76

To evaluate the device's performance, the 
:mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Device.simulate` method is called on the created
device with the given :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.+types.SeaState` object.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 77
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 77

Define the objective function value
-----------------------------------

The final step is to use data stored in the device to define the objective 
function value. The :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` definition gives a full 
list of the data available in the device, but for this case 'aggregated 
results' found in the :mat:attr:`~+WecOptTool.Device.aggregation` property 
(which is populated by a user defined callback) are used. In |RM3.m|_ the 
maximum absorbed power across all spectra in the given seastate is calculated 
and added as ``pow``. To make a minimisation problem, the negation of this 
value is taken: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 78
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 78

.. note::
    **Objective function:** The chosen objective function in|optimization.m|_ 
    can be altered to better approximate a more meaningful objective (e.g., 
    levelized cost of energy).

Set optimization solver
=======================

MATLAB's `fmincon <https://uk.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html>`_ 
optimization solver is used in |optimization.m|_.

The initial values, ``x0``, lower bounds, ``lb``, and upper bounds, 
``ub`` of the design variables can be set as follows.

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 24-27
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 24

Options can also be supplied for fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 29-37
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 29

.. note::
    The ``MaxFunctionEvaluations`` is set to 5 in |optimization.m|_ to permit 
    relatively quick runs, but can be increased to allow for a potentially 
    better solution (with the other options left as-is, this should require 150 
    function evaluations).

.. image:: /_static/example_optimplotfval.svg
   :alt: Progression of objective function value for RM3 example

In order to pass the above options, some dummy values must also be supplied for
other arguments required by fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 39-44
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 39

Run study and view results
==========================

Before using the objective function, the inputs must be simplified to allow 
fmincon to just pass the design variables. To do this an `anonymous function 
<https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html>`_ 
is defined, which requires the design variables as input and fixes the value of 
the Blueprint and SeaState object inputs: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 48-49
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 48

The study can be executed by calling fmincon:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 51-52
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 51

Once the calculation is complete, the ``x`` and ``fval`` variables show that 
the study has produced the following design: 

* r1: 5 [m]
* r2: 7.5 [m]
* d1: 1.125 [m]
* d2: 42 [m]
* Maximum absorbed power: 2357934.25081 [W]

Examine optimum device
======================

When MATLAB is executed in parallel, objects are copied to the parallel 
workers, executed and then destroyed. Therefore only the function value of each 
iteration remains in the MATLAB workspace. To allow the created devices to be 
recovered, WecOptTool stores their data in files, so that it can be retrieved 
later if desired. To recover the devices, the 
:mat:meth:`~+WecOptTool.Blueprint.recoverDevices` method of the Blueprint 
subclass is called, which returns an array of :mat:class:`~+WecOptTool.Device` 
objects: 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 54-55
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 54

.. warning::
    Once recovered, ownership of the files containing the stored data for
    the devices is transferred from the Blueprint to the Device objects. 
    Therefore, when the Device objects are deleted, so are the associated 
    files.

Next, the device that matches the best solution returned by fmincon must
be found. To do this, compare the :mat:attr:`~+WecOptTool.Device.geomParams`
parameter of the devices, until a match is found, as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 57-62
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 57

Finally, by using the :mat:func:`+WecOptTool.+plot.powerPerFreq` function, the 
spectral distribution of energy absorbed by the resulting design for each of 
the eight sea states can be shown. 

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/RM3/optimization.m
    :language: matlab
    :lines: 64
    :linenos:
    :lineno-start: 64
