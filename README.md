<sup>1</sup>_WecOptTool requires an input wave spectra which is formatted to 
match the output of the WAFO toolbox. These spectra can also be produced 'by 
hand' and an example spectra is stored in the `example_data` folder, to use if 
WAFO is not installed._ 

## Getting started

1. **(optional) Remove existing WecOptTool installation**: If you have a 
previous version of WecOptTool installed (at path '/path/to/WecOptTool'), it 
should be removed to avoid conflicts. This can be achieved using the MATLAB 
command prompt (alternatively the "Set Path" tool can be used to remove the 
toolbox): 

    ```matlab
    >> rmpath('/path/to/WecOptTool/toolbox');
    ```

1. **Add WecOptTool to your MATLAB path**: After downloading the WecOptTool 
source code to a path of your choosing (`/path/to/WecOptTool`), add the 
WecOptTool toolbox to your MATLAB path using the MATLAB command prompt 
(alternatively the "Set Path" tool can be used to add the toolbox): 

    ```matlab
    >> addpath('/path/to/WecOptTool/toolbox');
    >> savepath;
    ```

1. **Set up Nemoh:**

    a. ***Windows:*** Executables are provided in the 'Release' directory of 
    the NEMOH source code. These are installed into WecOptTool using the 
    `installNemoh.m` MATLAB script, run from the WecOptTool root directory, 
    as follows: 
    
    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> installNemoh('/path/to/NEMOH/Release');
    ```
    
    b. ***Linux:*** To set up NEMOH for linux, first, compile the executables 
    (you will need gfortran or the intel fortran compiler):
    
    ```
    $ cd /path/to/NEMOH
    $ make
    ```
    
    Executables will be created a new directory called 'bin', which must 
    then be installed into WecOptTool using the `installNemoh.m` MATLAB 
    script, run from the WecOptTool root directory: 
    
    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> installNemoh('/path/to/NEMOH/bin');
    ```

1. **Verify dependencies installation:** You can verify that the dependencies 
have been installed correctly by running the `dependencyCheck.m` script 
provided in the root directory of the WecOptTool source code. The script is 
called as follows: 

    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> dependencyCheck
    ```
    
    and successful output may look like this:
    
    ```

    Required
    --------
    Optimization Toolbox:       Found
    NEMOH:                      Found
    
    Optional
    --------
    Parallel Computing Toolbox: Not found
    WAFO:                       Found
    ```

1. **(optional) Run functionality tests:** A test suite is available to verify 
that the code is operational. A script is provided in the root directory of the 
WecOptTool source code and is run from the MATLAB command window, as follows: 

    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> runTests;
    ```

1. **Begin use:** See the
[`example.m`](https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/blob/master/example.m) 
file.

## NEMOH Files

A number of files are generated to handle inputs and outputs for the NEMOH
hydrodynamic solver. These files are stored within the source code root 
directory in the folder `~nemoh_runs`. This folder can become large, so
it is recommended to occasionally remove it and it is safe to remove if no
WecOptTool simulations are running.

## Code Architecture

The WecOptTool toolbox is divided into two main packages as follows:

1. **WecOptTool** provides the user interface to the toolbox. The main 
   components are: 
     * The `RM3Study` object, used for setting up a simulation.
     * The geometric and controller classes, as found in the `WecOptTool.geom` 
       and `WecOptTool.control` sub-packages, which are combined with a study 
       object to define the type of simulation desired.
     * Top level functions to control execution and examine results of the 
       simulation such as `WecOptTool.run` and `WecOptTool.result`.
2. **WecOptLib** contains most of the business logic for implementing the 
   studies created using the WecOptTool package. The sub-packages found 
   here are divided by purpose, for instance:
     * The `WecOptLib.nemoh` package contains functions related to 
       manipulating NEMOH.
     * The `WecOptLib.models` contain the logic relating to the modelled wave 
       device (currently only RM3).
   
   Note, any interfaces provided by WecOptLib are highly volatile and will
   change often. It is anticipated that only "super users" will use the 
   functions in WecOptLib directly.

The code architecture, for both the WecOptTool and WecOptLib packages, is 
subject to change as the code approaches maturity.

## Contributing

Contributions to the toolbox are welcome. The project follows a [trunk based 
development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) paradigm and updates to the 
code should be made through [pull requests](
https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

Contributions to the MATLAB source code should be submitted against the 
`master` branch, whilst contributions to the documentation are made against the 
`gh-pages` branch.

When submitting to the MATLAB source code please run the test suite first:

```matlab
>> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
>> runTests;
```

When the test suite has finished please add the generated `test_results.pdf` 
file, showing that all tests have passed, to the pull request description.

For contributions to the documentation, please please run a spell-check prior 
to submitting a pull request.

A code maintainer will review your pull request at the earliest possible
opportunity. For large pull requests, it would be advisable to open a related 
issue to discuss the purpose of your updates. The developers also would be 
grateful if *"Allow edits from maintainers"* is checked when making a pull 
request, as this will allow us to finalise your contributions more rapidly.

## RoadMap

### Introduction

This roadmap is for organizing and prioritizing the development and deployment
of this code and for improving the development team's working practices.

It is organized into 6 main sections, explained as follows:

1. Organization <- relating to the development team
2. Features <- planning or code related to the business logic
3. Implementation <- planning or code not related to the business logic
4. Testing <- for both integration and unit tests
5. Documentation <- located within the repository or otherwise
6. Deployment <- considering the needs of users and developers

Within each section is a list of tasks. Each task should have the following
format:

#### Title

* Description:
    Just the right amount of detail in here
* Status: proposed, active, complete or wontfix
* Link: https://cat-bounce.com/
* Last updated: 1979-09-25

Contributions to the roadmap should be submitted via a pull request, with an
associated issue created in the issue tracker if the addition is complex or
controversial. 

### Organisation

#### Add a change log

* Description:
    All good code has a change log and developers who update it. See 
    https://keepachangelog.com/
* Status: proposed
* Link:
* Last updated: 2020-02-24

### Features

### Implementation

#### Updating code architecture

* Description:
    The source code was organized into packages and a user interface was added 
    as a top level package under the name WecOptTool. Implementation was moved 
    to a top level package called WecOptLib. It is likely that the contents 
    of these packages will evolve as the project reaches maturity.
* Status: active
* Link: https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/issues/5
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

#### Reducing external dependencies

* Description:
    The required dependencies has been reduced to NEMOH only. WAFO is now an
    optional, if highly useful, dependency.
* Status: complete
* Link: https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/issues/33
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

#### NEMOH files to User folder

* Description:
    NEHOH files are now placed into a user-centric folder
    (AppData\Roaming\WecOptTool on Windows and .wecopttool on linux). A tool
    named dataTool is available to recover the path to the NEMOH files or
    to delete all files generated bt NEMOH.
* Status: complete
* Link: https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/issues/5
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

#### Control parallel pool size

* Description:
    Currently the fmincon optimiser will use whatever resources are available
    on the host machine. This should be made configurable by the user so that
    they can control how much processing power is given to MATLAB.
* Status: proposed
* Link:
* Last updated: 2020-02-27

### Testing

#### Expand unit test coverage

* Description:
    A function to run all tests currently available has been added called 
    runTests.m. Tests are stored in the WecOptLib.tests package. Coverage of
    the unit tests should be measured and the aim should be to cover the
    entire source base.
* Status: active
* Link:
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

### Documentation

#### Create a single unified README

* Description:
    The repository now contains a single README that contains this RoadMap
    and is being updated alongside other changes in preparation for the 
    first public release of the code.
* Status: active
* Link:
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

#### Docs for MATLAB documentation system

* Description:
    Documentation can be prepared in such a way that it can be integrated into 
    the MATLAB documentation system. This process is explained in 
    https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/display-custom-documentation.html 
    and could be the primary documentation or used in conjunction with another 
    documentation system.
* Status: proposed
* Link:
* Last updated: 2020-02-25

### Deployment

#### Reducing the repository size

* Description: The original repository was reset to focus on hosting of the
    source code.
* Status: complete
* Link: https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/issues/43
* Last updated: 2020-03-11

#### Add installation / uninstallation scripts

* Description:
    It is convenient for the user to have installation and uninstallation 
    scripts, that can be run from MATLAB, that will copy and remove the toolbox 
    into their path automatically. It is also useful from the developers 
    perspective, as documentation can be injected into the MATLAB documentation 
    system and links can be added to GUI components (should they be added in 
    the future).
