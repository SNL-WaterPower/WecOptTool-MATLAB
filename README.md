\* The latest WecOptTool release, version 0.1.0, was tested on **MATLAB 
2020a**, whilst the oldest compatible version known is **MATLAB 2018a**. Please 
help the development team by reporting compatibility with other versions 
[HERE]( https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/issues/91). The 
development version will support the latest available version of MATLAB, but no 
guarantees are given regarding legacy MATLAB support. 

<sup>1</sup>_WecOptTool requires an input wave spectra which is formatted to 
match the output of the WAFO toolbox; however these spectra can also be 
produced 'by hand', or other means, as long as they follow the same formatting. 

## Download

### Stable Version

The latest stable version of WecOptTool can be downloaded from the [Releases](
https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/releases/) section of this 
repository.

### Development Version

For the latest development version of WecOptTool, clone or  download this 
repository, using the [Clone or download](
https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
button.

Note that, although the developers endeavour to ensure that the development
version is not broken, bugs or unexpected behaviour may occur, so please beware.

## Getting Started

> :warning: Unexpected behaviour may occur if multiple versions of the toolbox 
  are installed. Please following the [Uninstall](#uninstall) instructions to 
  uninstall any previous versions of WecOptTool first.

1. **Download the WecOptTool software**: See the [Download](#download)
   section. If required, unzip the archive to a path of your choosing (i.e. 
   `/path/to/WecOptTool`).

1. **Add WecOptTool to your MATLAB path**: Add the WecOptTool toolbox to your 
   MATLAB path using the MATLAB command prompt:

    ```matlab
    >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/WecOptTool/toolbox'));
    >> savepath;
   ```
   
   Alternatively the “Set Path” graphical tool can be used to add the toolbox.

1. **Set up Nemoh:**

    a. ***Windows:*** Executables are provided in the 'Release' directory of 
    the NEMOH source code. These are installed into WecOptTool using the 
    `installNemoh.m` MATLAB script, run from the WecOptTool root directory, 
    as follows: 
    
    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> installNemoh('/path/to/NEMOH/Release');
    ```
    
    b. ***Linux:*** To set up NEMOH for linux, first, compile the executables 
    (you will need gfortran or the intel fortran compiler):
    
    ```
    $ cd /path/to/NEMOH
    $ make
    ```
    
    Executables will be created a new directory called 'bin', which must 
    then be installed into WecOptTool using the `installNemoh.m` MATLAB 
    script, run from the WecOptTool root directory: 
    
    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> installNemoh('/path/to/NEMOH/bin');
    ```

1. **Verify dependencies installation:** You can verify that the dependencies 
have been installed correctly by running the `dependencyCheck.m` script 
provided in the root directory of the WecOptTool source code. The script is 
called as follows: 

    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> dependencyCheck
    ```
    
    and successful output may look like this:
    
    ```
    WecOptTool dependency checker
    -------------------------------
    
    Required
    --------
    Optimization Toolbox:       Found
    NEMOH:                      Found
    
    Optional
    --------
    Parallel Computing Toolbox: Not found
    WAFO:                       Found
    ```

1. **(optional) Run functionality tests:** A test suite is available to verify 
that the code is operational. A script is provided in the root directory of the 
WecOptTool source code and is run from the MATLAB command window, as follows: 

    ```matlab
    >> cd /path/to/WecOptTool
    >> runTests;
    ```

   There should be no *Failed* or *Incomplete* tests at the end of the run.
   For example:
   
    ```
    Totals:
          27 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Incomplete.
          209.4266 seconds testing time.
    ```

1. **Begin use:** See the 
[`basic`](https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/blob/master/examples/RM3/basic.m) 
or
[`optimization`](https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool/blob/master/examples/RM3/optimization.m)
examples for the RM3 device.

## Uninstall

Uninstall a previous version of WecOptTool using the MATLAB command prompt: 

```matlab
>> rmpath(genpath('/path/to/WecOptTool/toolbox'));
```

Alternatively the "Set Path" graphical tool can be used to remove the toolbox.

## Data Files

A number of files are generated by WecOptTool to handle inputs and outputs, 
particularly for the NEMOH hydrodynamic solver. These files are stored within a 
temporary folder associated to the `Blueprint` subclass object and are deleted upon 
destruction of the object. If you wish to retrieve these files prior to 
deletion, use the `saveData` method, as shown here for the RM3 example: 

```matlab
blueprint = RM3()                           % Create the RM3Study object
 ...                                        % Run some cases
blueprint.saveData(/path/to/save/folder)    % Save the data to a given path
```

## Code Architecture

The WecOptTool toolbox is divided into two main packages as follows:

1. **WecOptTool** provides the user interface to the toolbox. The main 
   components are: 
     * The `Blueprint` class, used for creating new WEC models.
     * The `Device` class, whose objects are created by Blueprints
       and are used to simulate a particular device configuration
2. **WecOptLib** contains additional business logic for testing and 
   implementing the WecOptTool package.
   
   Note, any interfaces provided by WecOptLib are highly volatile and will
   change often. It is anticipated that only "super users" will use the 
   functions in WecOptLib directly.

The code architecture, for both the WecOptTool and WecOptLib packages, is 
subject to change as the code approaches maturity.

## Documentation

The documentation is published at [snl-waterpower.github.io/WecOptTool](
https://snl-waterpower.github.io/WecOptTool/). The documentation source code 
is found in the `docs` folder and HTML is compiled using the [Sphinx](
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation generator.

### Compile Instructions

These instructions work for both Linux and Windows. For Windows, remember to
replace slashes (`/`) in paths with backslashes (`\ `).

#### Setup Sphinx (One Time Only)

1. Install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

2. Download sphixcontrib-versioning (from [H0R5E](
   https://github.com/H0R5E/sphinxcontrib-versioning)):
   
   ```
   > git clone --single-branch --branch v1.8.5_support https://github.com/H0R5E/sphinxcontrib-versioning.git <path/to/sphinxcontrib-versioning>
   ```
   Replace `<path/to/sphinxcontrib-versioning>` with a path of your choosing.

3. Create the Sphinx environment:
   
   ```
   > conda create -c conda-forge -n _sphinx click colorama colorclass future pip "sphinx=1.8.5" sphinx_rtd_theme 
   > activate _sphinx
   (_sphinx) > pip install sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain
   (_sphinx) > cd path/to/sphinxcontrib-versioning
   (_sphinx) > pip install -e .
   (_sphinx) > conda deactivate
   >
   ```

> :warning: sphinxcontrib-versioning is installed in development mode, so 
  **do not delete** the folder where it is stored.

#### Testing the Current Branch

The documentation for the current branch can be built locally for inspection 
prior to publishing. They are built in the `docs/_build` directory. Note, 
unlike the final documentation, version tags and other branches will not be 
available. 

To test the current branch, use the following:

```
> activate _sphinx
(_sphinx) > cd path/to/WecOptTool
(_sphinx) > sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
(_sphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```

#### Building Final Version Locally

The final documentation can be built locally for inspection prior to 
publishing. They are built in the `docs/_build` directory. Note, docs are built 
from the remote, so only pushed changes will be shown. 

To build the docs as they would be published, use the following:

```
> activate _sphinx
(_sphinx) > cd path/to/WecOptTool 
(_sphinx) > sphinx-versioning build -abt docs docs/_build/html
(_sphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```

To build the docs with a current feature branch as the default docs use:

```
> activate _sphinx
(_sphinx) > cd path/to/WecOptTool 
(_sphinx) > sphinx-versioning build -ab r <feature-branch> docs docs/_build/html
(_sphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```

The front page of the docs can be accessed at 
`WecOptTool/docs/_build/html/index.html`. 

#### Publishing Final Version Remotely

The WecOptTool docs are rebuilt automatically following every merge commit made 
to the master branch of the [SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool](
https://github.com/SNL-WaterPower/WecOptTool) repository. They can also be 
published manually, as follows:

```
> activate _sphinx
(_sphinx) > cd path/to/WecOptTool 
(_sphinx) > sphinx-versioning push -abt -e .nojekyll -e README.md -P <REMOTE> docs <BRANCH> .
(_sphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```

\<REMOTE\> refers to the git remote which will be pushed to and \<BRANCH\> 
refers to the target branch on the remote. Note, this command will add a new 
commit to the remote, so use with care.

### Docstring Formatting

Docstring formatting should be [Google style] for auto documentation with 
[sphinx.ext.napoleon]. See the docstrings in the WecOptTool package for 
examples.

[Google style]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html#example-google)
[sphinx.ext.napoleon]: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html
